# Understanding vulnerability
Allows staff to capture vulnerability and assets and have them surfaced in Single View.

## Getting started
This project uses **yarn** for dependency management and is built with Next.js.

1. Install the project dependencies
   ```
   yarn
   ```
2. Create a `.env` file based off of the `.env.sample` that exists.
3. [Set up DynamoDB Local](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DynamoDBLocal.html)
or start a local dynamodb container with Docker like so: `docker run -p 8000:8000 amazon/dynamodb-local -jar DynamoDBLocal.jar -inMemory -sharedDb`
4. Configure AWS cli with `aws configure`
5. Create local DynamoDB plans table
   ```bash
   aws dynamodb create-table --cli-input-json file://./config/tables/vulnerabilities.json --endpoint-url http://localhost:8000
   ```
6. Start running your local copy of understanding vulnerability.
   ```
   yarn dev
   ```

7. (Optional) add some test data: 
```
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:3000/api/snapshots \
  -H 'cache-control: no-cache' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -H 'postman-token: 2a068e9c-3c70-57a0-f1bb-a20fca0bd2dd' \
  -d '{
"firstName" : "Sue",
"lastName" : "Taylor",
"dob": {},
"systemIds": ["xyz"],
"createdBy": ""

}'
```
which should return a `201` with a snapshot id like: `rrCN4o37`. Then browse to `http://localhost:3000/snapshots/rrCN4o37` to verify the page opens, if that is the case your local setup is complete.

## Working with DynamoDB locally
If you need to view, edit or delete data from your local copy of DynamoDB when working on a feature
there is a useful admin tool you can run.

```(bash)
yarn dynamo-admin
```

## Testing

### Unit tests
Unit tests are written with Jest, we are using `@testing-library/react` for React component testing.

```(bash)
yarn unit-test
```

### Integration tests
Integration tests are written with Cypress.

```(bash)
yarn int-test # starts a local copy and runs all tests
yarn cypress-open # opens Cypress for local development
```

## Deployment
Infrastructure and code are deployed to AWS using Serverless.

### Automated deployments
Merging into `master` triggers an automated deployment into the staging environment.
To promote this to production you will need to manually approve the deployment in CircleCI.

## Pages and API endpoints
Login is handled by Single View, so long as the Hackney token cookie is set users will be signed in here too.

### GET /api/snapshots/{id}
Retrieves a vulnerabilities snapshot, given a snapshot id.

### POST /api/snapshots/find
Used by other applications (such as Single View) to find snapshots related to a particular person given their name, an optionally an array of identifiers.

### POST /api/snapshots
Creates a new, empty, vulnerabilities snapshot for a specified person.

### /loggedout
The page displayed when a user is logged out.

### /snapshots/{id}
Displays a vulnerability snapshot, if there is no data saved this will display the edit view - else it displays a readonly view of the snapshot.
